					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>"The Shah Deo's were the erstwhile rulers of Jharkhand. They came to power in the 2nd century after the Munda kings handed over the throne. Their palace still exists at Ratu, 11 km from the current Capital of Ranchi. Their first capital was at Sutiyambe near Ranchi. Remains of the period are still their for all to see. The first Ruler was Maharaja Phanimukut Rai. His descendents ruled over Jharkhand for around 2000 years till India's independence from the British rule. The good tribal rulers continued to thrive and were known as the Munda Rajas, and exist to this day. (These are regions which are still semi- autonomous."</p>

<p align="justify">Jharkhand revolts

1772-1780 Paharia revolt
1780-1785 Tilka Manjhi led the tribal revolt and managed to injure the British army Chief. In 1785, Tilka Manjhi was hanged to death in Bhagalpur
1795-1800 Tamar revolt
1795-1800 Munda revolt under the leadership of Vishnu Manaki

1832-1833 Khewar revolt under the leadership of Bhagirath, Dubai Gosai and Patel Singh
1833-1834 Bhumji revolt under the leadership of Ganga Narain of Birbhum
1855 Santhals waged war against the permanent settlement of Lord Cornwallis
1855-1860 During late 1850s Sidhu had accumulated about ten thousands Santhal to run parallel government against British rule. The basic purpose was to collect taxes by making his own laws. British Government had announced an award of Rs. 10,000 to arrest Sidhu and his brother Kanhu
1856-1857 Martyr Sahid Lal, Vishwanath Shahdeo, Sheikh Bhikhari, Ganpatrai and Budhu Veer led a movement against the British Government during India’s First War of Independence, 1857, also called Sepoy Mutiny
1874 Kherwar Movement shot into fame under the leadership of Bhagirathi Manjhi
1895-1900 Movement against the British raj led by Birsa Munda (born 15 November 1875). Birsa Munda was captured by British forces and declared dead on 9 June 1900 in Ranchi Jail, due to Cholera, according to records of the British colonial government.
All of these uprisings were quelled by the British through massive deployment of troops across the region.
In 1914 the Tana Bhagat resistance movement started, which gained the participation of more than 26,000 adivasis, and eventually merged with Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha and Civil Disobedience movement.People visit Jharkhand not just to visit other places, but other times. The past is unbelievably attractive, and unarguably authentic. If you seek authenticity, if you seek cultural roots and long traditions that bind past to present - come to Jharkhand. It is your befitting alternative to the corporate present.
Walk through some of the places described, and see again the stone and spirit of a land as ancient as time. You will never lose your sense of awe, and the element of surprise will give you company every step of the way.
You will then realize that you have come across a priceless heritage, that will never be re-made, that will never be replicated, that will never be altered. Every destination will be like a mythic deliverance for the traveler interested in history and archaeology. Enchantment will go hand in hand with your journey into Jharkhand's past - a meeting ground, the common place of Indian history, a plural embracing of religious beliefs, a multitude of heroes, gods and goddesses, rubbing shoulders with the living, casting a benevolent eye on Jharkhand's progress into the future.
