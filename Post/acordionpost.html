  <div>
		<ul>
			<li>Assistant Superintendent, or assistant superintendent of police (ASP), was a rank used by police forces in the British Empire. It was usually the lowest rank that could be held by a European officer, most of whom joined the police at this rank. In the 20th century, it was in many territories opened to non-Europeans as well. Today, this rank is found throughout The Commonwealth in police ranking structures including the UK's Scotland Yard and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Commonwealth Caribbean states. The rank is above inspector (chief inspector) and below superintendent.</li>

	<div>
	<ul>
	<li>Deputy superintendent, or deputy superintendent of police (DSP), was a rank used by police forces of the British Empire. In some territories it was called Deputy District Superintendent of police (DDSP).

The rank was usually confined to Europeans, and not all territories used it. The rank below was usually assistant superintendent and the rank above was (District) superintendent.

In India, the rank is assistant commissioner of police in commissionerate system, whereas at district level the rank is deputy superintendent of police. The rank of deputy superintendent (DSP) or assistant commissioner of police (ACP) was created in 1876 as the policy of Indianisation was introduced. Deputy superintendents or assistant commissioners of police are state police officers who belong to the provincial police forces, either direct entrants at that rank or promoted from inspector. Assistant commissioner of police, who are members of the provincial forces (equivalent rank deputy superintendents) are equal in every way to IPS (equivalent rank assistant superintendent of police) although paid slightly less and fill the same positions (sub divisional police officer). Deputy superintendents of police (assistant commissioner of police) who show potential could be promoted to the IPS after some limited years of service which varies from 8 to 15 years depending on the state.[1] In the states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, it is known as Circle Officer (CO). It is roughly analogous to the rank of chief inspector in the UK police services.</li>
